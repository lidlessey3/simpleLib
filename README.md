# My basic lib

This is a C library I made for one of my exams, it is a very basic implementation o a list, BST, Priority queue and hashtable.
In the future I plan to:

- finish writing the priority queue implementation.
- completly rewrite the hashtable implementation as I don't particurlaly like how it works right now.
- add comments to both the list and BST implementation, as of right now they have none.
